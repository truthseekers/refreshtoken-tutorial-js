This tutorial is a mess, and is not complete. Saving for my own reference, but the login works, and the privateposts will have a refreshtoken refresh the access token once before expiration.

Todos:
    - Complete the setup of the app.
        - Logout functionality
        - Re-route the person to a protected route.
        - Incorrect Password
        - Incorrect Email
        - Invalid token
        - Add passport.js (in a separate thing)


Record Keeping:
        - Make sure entire flow for all tasks is accounted for with my #'s for nest-react-fullstack.
            - Logout
            - Refreshed token.


Done:
	- Login flow
    - Auto Refresh refresh token exists and is valid.
    - LogIn functionality
